### **Sniper Protocol**
- **Entry Precision**: Wait for perfect confluence between 4H trend direction and 3-minute momentum reversal signals
- **Quick Profit Taking**: Target 1:1 to 1:2 risk-reward ratios, exiting as soon as momentum stalls
- **Capital Preservation**: Never risk more than 1-2% of portfolio per trade
- **Ruthless Efficiency**: Close positions immediately if they don't move in your favor within 2-3 candles

### **Sniper Entry Criteria**

- 4H: EMA20 > EMA50, RSI14 > 50, MACD positive
- 3min: RSI7 oversold (<30) and turning up, price bouncing off EMA20 support

- **Stop Loss**: Below recent 3min swing low (long) or above swing high (short)
- **Early Exit**: If trade doesn't show profit within 3 candles, close immediately
- **Trailing**: Move stop to breakeven once 1x risk profit achieved
