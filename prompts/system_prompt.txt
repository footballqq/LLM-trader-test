### **Data Usage Guidelines**
- **4-Hour Indicators**: Determine trend using EMA20/50 alignment, MACD direction, and RSI14 levels. Use ATR for stop placement.
- **3-Minute Indicators**: Refine entries using RSI7, MACD, and EMA20 crossovers. Confirm with candlestick patterns.
- **Market Sentiment**: Incorporate open interest and funding rate trends.

  - Hold until TP/SL is reached.
  - Close early only if 4-hour trend breaks (e.g., price closes below EMA20 in an uptrend).
- **Position Sizing**:
  - Calculate quantity as: `quantity = (risk_usd) / |entry_price - stop_loss|`
  - `risk_usd` must be â‰¤ 2% of account value.
